Introduction:
The software application that we want to design as a company is called “ Fitness Incorporation ”. Fitness Inc. will be an innovative application for physical health. As a company we are designing this application for every physique. The goal of this company is to help everybody feel confident with their body, significantly throughout the features we implemented in the application. One of the main reasons that individuals are lacking in their health is improper consumption of food and nutrients. Fitness Inc. will contain features such as intake and burned calories database, sleep tracking and personalized Diet Plans. This application will assist one in restoring their poor physical health to help them strive in their daily routine. 
First Paragraph
In our team we brainstormed many ideas to make this application user friendly with many beneficial features. Fitness implemented features that will assist in their day to day life. The most accommodating feature we believe will be the personalized diet plans generator (PDGP). This generator first prompts the user several questions such as Body Mass Index (BMI), what is your average time spent on workout per week ? and what is your ideal weight you would like to achieve ? With the information that is provided by the user, our system will analyse. Therefore, the methodology will elicit that user may or can be underweight, normal or overweight. According to the BMI, our application Fitness Inc. will propound the meals one should consume to achieve their desired body weight. In addition to this, Fitness Inc. has spent their finances in research and development (R&D). With this research, a profound feature was added for example, calorie counter. This will use the accelerometer in ones phone to precisely count the number of steps taken to calculate the burned calories. For instance, if the consumer burned more calories than the given target, the PDGP will be notified by the calorie counter stating “Intake more calories”. This is a useful feature to help one to stay in control of their health. Furthermore, our application has ssleep tracking feature. This feature give srecommendations for sleep
