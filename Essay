Introduction:
The software application that we want to design as a company is called “ Fitness Incorporation ”. Fitness Inc. will be an innovative application for physical health. As a company we are designing this application for every physique. The goal of this company is to help everybody feel confident with their body, significantly throughout the features we implemented in the application. One of the main reasons that individuals are lacking in their health is improper consumption of food and nutrients. Fitness Inc. will contain features such as intake and burned calories database, sleep tracking and personalized Diet Plans. This application will assist one in restoring their poor physical health to help them strive in their daily routine. 
First Paragraph
In our team we brainstormed many ideas to make this application user friendly with many beneficial features. Fitness implemented features that will assist in their day to day life. The most accommodating feature we believe will be the personalized diet plans generator (PDGP). This generator first prompts the user several questions such as Body Mass Index (BMI), what is your average time spent on workout per week ? and what is your ideal weight you would like to achieve ? With the information that is provided by the user, our system will analyse. Therefore, the methodology will elicit that user may or can be underweight, normal or overweight. According to the BMI, our application Fitness Inc. will propound the meals one should consume to achieve their desired body weight. In addition to this, Fitness Inc. has spent their finances in research and development (R&D). With this research, a profound feature was added for example, calorie counter. This will use the accelerometer in ones phone to precisely count the number of steps taken to calculate the burned calories. For instance, if the consumer burned more calories than the given target, the PDGP will be notified by the calorie counter stating “Intake more calories”. This is a useful feature to help one to stay in control of their health. Furthermore, our application has ssleep tracking feature. This feature give srecommendations for sleep 
Fitness inc. is available on different platforms such as android, ios and smartwatches etc. as this is a graphically intensive application an integrated GPU is a major necessity. One’s device must meet all minimum requirements to run this application. Due to the fact fitness inc. As a tracking application additional sensors such as GPS, gyroscope and accelerometer are mandatory. For android, the minimum requirements are that one's device should have at least 350 Mb for just installation. Additional storage will be required to save any encrypted files to the device. Fitness inc. for android is compatible with smartphones running Android 8 and up. Random Access Memory (RAM) is an essential element in the application as it is required to run everything smoothly and efficiently. The minimum requirement for Random Access Memory is 500 Mb. Correspondingly, iOS has similar requirements to efficiently run the application. The requisite to install Fitness Inc. for iOS is 600 Mb. The latest version of iOS is recommended by the developer to run the application but we currently only support iOS 12 and later. Similarly, additional space is also required to save any encrypted files to the device. Considering fitness inc is better optimized for iOS it only requires 200 Mb of RAM. For both operating systems, a stable internet connection is a basic requirement. This application is available, both for Watch os and wear os. The requirements are identical for the wearable device as it requires 100 Mb of storage. The RAM requirement is 500 Mb. The watch must include sensors such as NFC (near field communication), GPS, Accelerometer and Heart rate sensor. These are requirements that help one effectively use all the features with ease. Without these sensors, one will not be able to use the application as described.
